Google Cloud Messaging - Android Demo App
==========================================

This is a demo app used to demonstrate demonstrates various aspects of
interacting with GCM on Android. Specifically, it covers:

* Registering a client app
* Sending downstream, upstream and notification messages
* Subscribing to topics
* Creating notification groups
* Using the network manager to schedule tasks

A full GCM implementation requires both a client implementation and a server
implementation. For more information on GCM, including an overview and
integration instructions, see
[Cloud Messaging](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/).

## Getting Started

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio. To use the
app you will need a sender ID to be able to register and test client side APIs,
and an API key to be able to test server side APIs. For more information, see
[Implementing GCM Client on Android](https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/android/client).
